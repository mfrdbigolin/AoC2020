# *AoC2020*: My Advent of Code 2020 Solutions [![Public license](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT_(Expat)-yellow?logo=spdx&logoColor=white)](./LICENSE)

My       Python       solutions        to       [Advent       of       Code
2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/)  (*AoC2020* for  short) in  this most
august time of the year.

I strive  to make the solutions  as general as possible,  meaning that they
could be used to solve similar  problems like those presented by *AoC2020*.
I also  aim for  readability and  the efficiency  of my  algorithms, though
these are secondary concerns.

## Usage

For each day *N* use either

* `python src/day`*`N`*`.py inputs/day`*`N`*`.txt`, or

* `chmod +x src/day`*`N`*`.py`

  `src/./day`*`N`*`.py inputs/day`*`N`*`.txt`
